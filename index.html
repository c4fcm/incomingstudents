              <p>Sophia Brueckner, born in Detroit, MI, is an artist and engineer. Inseparable from computers since the age of one, she believes she is a cyborg. She received her Sc.B. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from Brown University. As a software engineer at Google, she worked on the front-end development and interface design of products used by tens of millions and later on experimental projects within Google Research. Brueckner recently earned her MFA in Digital + Media at the Rhode Island School of Design and was also an instructor there teaching a course on science fiction and art.  Her artwork has been exhibited internationally, and, in particular, she is interested in interaction design, generative art, algorithmic writing, and, as a technology antidote, painting. She feels an urgency to understand and bring awareness to technology's controlling effects, and to encourage the ethical and thoughtful design of new technologies.

              <p>Deepak Jagdish is a computational media designer (and occasionally a developer) interested in crafting visual representations of systems ranging from behavioral patterns to cities to biological systems. His undergrad background is an eclectic mix of computer science & signal processing, followed by a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from Georgia Tech. He then worked for a couple of years at Nokia Research building visualizations using some large-scale realtime data sets. At the Media Lab, he hopes to delve deeper (beyond the visual layer) into some lesser known territories like the human mind, or movements of celestial bodies, and attempt to understand & appreciate their complexities better by building interactive representations of such systems.

Since then he's been working on video games, first as the AI lead on Bungie's mega-hit Halo first-person shooter games for Xbox, and more recently through his consulting shop, Naimad Games, and as a co-founder of Moonshot Games, a small game studio start-up, whose first title is slated for release this November. He has spoken about games, AI and design at the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), the Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference (AIIDE) and at Siggraph, and is a frequent speaker at the Game Developers Conference (GDC). His great loves apart from games and AI, include game engine design, character animation, interaction design, narrative and interactive story-telling, and plays in which the characters are really mean to each other. He's back at the lab to learn something about how language works.</p>
